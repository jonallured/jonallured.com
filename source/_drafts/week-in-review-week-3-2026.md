title: "Week in Review: Week 3, 2026"
---

This was another hard week to be living in Minnesota. Don't listen to what the
White House is telling you - this ICE activity has nothing to do with fraud and
everything to do with terrorizing a community for political reasons. Hard to
stay positive but sometimes channeling my feelings into working on my personal
projects provides some relief. I did that a lot this week.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [Blog Balm][pt-103] for Pudding Time
* published [Configure Spec Task Without Verbose Output][post-89] on here
* published [Building Analytics Reports in Rails Using Apache Logs][post-90] on
  here
* created [23 Pull Requests][gh-activity]

The biggest thing was landing the work to create an Analytics section on my
Rails app for this website. That blog post goes into great detail but I'll just
say that it feels really good to have that done and shipped. I did have to fix
something today because I wasn't correctly managing the new access log data so
I'll see if that fix worked tomorrow.

## Pic of the Week

On Friday the Marvel Rivals game started a new season and now you can play as
Deadpool. When Jack got home from school he got some time to try him out and he
really likes the new character:

{%
  include
  framed_image.html
  alt="Jack jumping"
  caption="You would think jumping like this would mess him up."
  ext="jpg"
  loading="eager"
  slug="jack-jump"
%}

## Next Week

Monday is a holiday here in the US - Martin Luther King Jr. Day and so I have
that day off work. Jess and Jack have it off school too so we will all be home
pondering how this country has fallen so low. There's talk of a protest day on
Friday and I'm keeping an eye on that.

In terms of projects - maybe on Monday I'll find some motivation to build
something. It might be a good time to upgrade to Ruby 4. I'll also be monitoring
my fancy new ETL pipeline to make sure my Analytics section is working
correctly.
