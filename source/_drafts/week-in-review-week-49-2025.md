title: "Week in Review: Week 49, 2025"
---

It's been a while since my last review post just because life has been so busy.
There was a work trip in there to Toronto plus then a trip to Arizona for the
Thanksgiving holiday. Getting caught up with things kinda left me with not much
time for writing.

I _did_ find the time to land a bunch of work around improving the images on my
site so that was a huge accomplishment!

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [Overhauling My Blog Post Images][post-83]

## Pic of the Week

There wasn't a ton of snow on the driveway but there was enough to see how well
the kid could do clearing it by himself. He did great! And now I know he can do
it so I can't wait to make him do even more work in the future.

## Next Week

Now that I'm done researching and tinkering with the images on the site, I'm
back to thinking about Apache log file reports. I made good progress on this but
was not fully finished. I'll return to this work, brush off some dust, and see
about getting it over the finish line.
