title: "Week in Review: Week 50, 2025"
---

I didn't have a ton of time to work on personal projects this week but I did
dive back into my Rails app and analytics reporting. I reviewed the work I had
done like a month ago and then started over. Using system tests to drive out the
same type of reporting, I ended up getting another side of the project better
understood.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO

## Pic of the Week

This week we were pressed for time and had to have a fast dinner so we ended up
at McDonald's. Jack convinced me that although it was single digit temperatures
outside it was still a great time to have some ice cream. He initially got the
wrong kind and was upset. Then he composed himself, got up and went to the
counter and proceeded to tell them that he had ordered a different flavor. They
made him a new one that was what he wanted and he got to work.

I like seeing this in my kid: he does not need me to do everything for him and
he can advocate for himself. This was a small, easy thing to put right so why
not get out of the way and let Jack figure it out ya know?

## Next Week

I'm hoping that this week I can fully land the analytics reports I've been
working on - I want these numbers! How many page views do these blog posts get?
Which posts seem to get traffic even many years after being published? Which
browsers are people using to view my site?

This is also the last week before 2 weeks off for the holidays so I'm trying to
wrap up some stuff at work as well. Almost there!
