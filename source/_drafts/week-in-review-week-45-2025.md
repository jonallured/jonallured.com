This week we changed our clocks and gained an hour. Somehow I was still pretty
messed up from it. Waking up at 5:30 in the morning some days - brutal. Only hit
the pool for a swim one day but better than nothing. Still I was fairly
productive despite not quite landing what I was hoping to finish up this week.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [Active Vinyl][pt-101] and [Keep Loose][pt-102] for Pudding Time

New season of Pudding Time starting publishing this week so that's fun! Gotta
get some guests booked.

I spent some time tinkering with Jekyll Tags and learning how they work. My
strategy was to separate these "review" types of posts from my normal ones and
then apply a "favorite" label to my best ones.

This made me want to have another look at the sidebar. I added a [Review
Posts][reviews] item and then had the idea to collect my offsite writing. I took
a trip down memory lane and dug up all the blog posts I had written while at
Hashrocket and Artsy. Then I copy/pasted that content into new posts and back
dated them. I added a [Crossposts][] section for them.

## Next Week

I'm still working on using the Apache access log data that I've tinkered with to
create analytics reports on my Rails app but I didn't quite land that yet. I got
super far but got distracted by something else. Need to put that distraction
aside and ship.

If I have time I can return to that distraction which is doing a deeper dive on
image optimizations for this site. I had a few ideas and again got pretty far
but was not able to quite get something done. Here's a sneak peek via my [Image
Tester][image-tester] page. What am I up to???
