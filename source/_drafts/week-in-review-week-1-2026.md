title: "Week in Review: Week 1, 2026"
---

This week was the second of my 2 weeks off for the holidays. I can't believe how
fast it went and how few things I actually crossed off my list of things to do!
Not that I didn't accomplish a lot - it's more that once again I see myself
unable to correctly predict how long it will take to do something. Programmers
know: estimation is hard!

## Highlights

* worked 0:00, 40:00 PTO
* published [Fixing Issues in CRUD Pages With JSON Fields][post-86]

## Pic of the Week

We hosted a holiday meal at our house and broke out the fancy dishes. The kids
made everyone place cards and I really liked mine!

## Next Week

Tomorrow I'm back to work and normal life. I'm mostly ready for this. I expect
I'll be ramping back up on my work project but maybe I'll have time to ship a
few minor things that I have on my list for personal projects.
