title: "Week in Review: Week 6, 2026"
---

There were parent/teacher conferences this week so the boy was off school
Thursday and Friday. He's 10 so not too bad but I just found it hard to focus.
We went to the gym on Friday and hit the pool which was pretty fun. He likes to
put on the flippers they let kids use and race me. He always wins!

Minnesota is still a mess despite what the media or the White House might be
saying. As a tiny bit of positive news though, I will tell you that I got hooked
up with an organization that helps get food to people that are too scared to
leave their house. This was the second week where I got a grocery list, went
shopping, and then dropped the food at this organization. Then other volunteers
collected it for delivery to these families.

I mean I'm not protesting in the streets but this did feel really good. Very
direct help to those in need. But. BUT. This is not normal and we should not
rest until ICE is abolished.

## Highlights

* worked 40:30, no PTO
* published [New Old][pt-104]
* created [9 Pull Requests][gh-activity]

I spent most of my time for personal projects tinkering with my CLI tools. This
work is both fun and also annoying. My love of Ruby and boring tools has lead me
to use [Thor][] as the foundation for these tools and wow is it painful to work
with. I'm getting there though - almost have some patterns I don't hate.

## Some Best Things

Are you playing [Enclose Horse][eh] yet? You should really be playing that game
every day - I usually play while I'm drinking my coffee in the morning. Watch
out for bees! I guess h/t to [Erik Krietsch][erik] but he knows what he did to
me and my free time.

## Superb Owl Prediction

My mind tells me that the Patriots will win yet again but my heart hopes both
teams lose somehow. I suppose I'll cheer for the Seahawks. Official prediction
for bragging rights in case I'm right: SEA 17 / NE 24.

## Next Week

You are running out of time to get your Valentine's Day card and flowers
arranged. And by "you" I mean "me". Gotta do that tomorrow for sure. Other than
that I have a chill week it looks like. I expect to do another grocery store run
for some needy families so looking forward to that. Oh and I really do want this
to be the week I upgrade my Ruby projects to 4 - it's time.
