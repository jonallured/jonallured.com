<h1>Rotten Links</h1>

<p>
  You've reached this page because you clicked a link on this site that goes
  to a page that is no longer available. This is called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
  and it sucks. I don't want to have invalid links on my site, but I also
  don't want to lose the context that the link was trying to provide.
</p>
<p>
  The best I can do for you is to preserve the original destination of the
  link here, un-hyperlinked. It's possible you'll be able to find another
  page on the site where the content has been moved, or maybe you can find a
  similar page on another site. Good luck, internet friend!! :D

<p>Note: Check the anchor in the URL if you haven't been scrolled down.</p>

<ol>
  {% for link in site.data.rotten_links %}
  <li>
    <a name="{{ link.id}}"></a>
    {{ link.url }}
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
