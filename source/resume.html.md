# Resume

## Professional Objective

I want to work for a company that specializes in web and mobile applications and
cares about design. I love building things and I want to work with and learn
from other people who do too. I care about open source and I want the company I
work for to share that feeling.

## Development Perspective

The high value I place on having empathy for users is what I think makes me
really good at developing software. It's important to look at what you're
working on from their perspective and take their needs seriously.

Bringing clarity to projects is as much about what one leaves out as what one
includes. Sure, it's about great copy and usable interfaces, but it's also about
saying no. I care about keeping the things I work on focused on what's really
important.

Being a part of the technology industry means accepting the responsibility of
staying current and continuously learning. This is challenging but it's vital to
ensure you arrive at the right technical decision. I often lean on my experience
to know when to make the "boring" choice.

## Open Source Projects

I work on a number of projects for myself and the wider development community.
Probably my most well known project is a list of Ruby conferences called
[RubyConferences.org][rc]. Averaging around 1,500 pageviews a month, the site
helps people find events both future and past.

Once the community got wind of it, the site really took on a life of it's own.
I'm still the top contributor, but I'm proud of the 40+ people that have helped
keep this site up-to-date over the last two years.

But my first foray into maintaining open source was taking over [Feedjira][].
The project was a successful mess - used by many, but not actively maintained.
The Issues and PRs were out of control so I started with just getting back to
people and merging code. I cut the first 1.0 release and then went on to cut a
2.0 with some changes that I wanted. I'm not as involved anymore, but have been
able to find others to take up the torch.

There are other projects too - I've got a time tracking Rails app called
[Forty][]. I wrote a CLI to help me pair program called [pear][] and I have my
own personal Rails monolith called [Monolithium][]

Did I mention that I love to build things?
