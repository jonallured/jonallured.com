title: "Week in Review: Week 46, 2025"
---

This was a short week with Tuesday being a holiday and I took Thursday off
because I wasn't feeling well. I have a bunch of notes and 2 blog post drafts
but was not able to finalize them.

I'm trying something new this week where I look through my photos and choose one
to feature in the weekly review. Seems like a fun way to liven up these posts
and gives me an excuse to share a bit more.

## Highlights

* worked 24:00, 16:00 PTO
* shipped [Image Tester page][pr-164]

I've always heard this called "aurora borealis" or "northern lights" but I guess
what's really happening is that the sun is doing something called a "coronal
mass ejection" which sounds like a sex thing. Charged particles blasting the
Earth? Come on. Ok fine I guess nerds call it a [geomagnetic storm][nyt].

We started hearing from friends and family that they were seeing amazing things
in the sky around 8:00pm and so we rushed out onto our deck and looked up. Huh,
I don't see anything that's lame, I thought.

Then I opened up my camera, pointed it up and was blown away. The fact that this
beauty was there but I couldn't see it without some help felt like magic.

## Next Week

I fly to Toronto for a work trip tomorrow and then return on Friday. This trip
will be the first time I meet many of my coworkers in person so I'm really
looking forward to it. Plus it'll be nice to see Toronto again - I like that
city.

I won't have much time to rest because then on Sunday I'm headed to Arizona to
spend Thanksgiving with family. It has not been that cold here in Minnesota but
I'm still looking forward to the warmer weather. Plus it'll be great to spend
some time with my family and seeing them interact with Jack.

If I can find the time I'm still hoping to land a few more structural changes to
the site. I've been tinkering with the layout and did move to a single column
which I need to write up into a blog post. Then I'm almost done with an overhaul
of how I handle images on the site. Completing that work will be huge.
