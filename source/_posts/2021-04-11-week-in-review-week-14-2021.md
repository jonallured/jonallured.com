Not too much to report this week - I was mostly focused on some server-side
updates to how Artsy integrates with Braze. This occurs in a system called
Gravity which is sadly closed-source so I can't even link to some of the epic
PRs I made, haha!

Based on some pondering from [last week][post-51], I took a shot at making a
shim to pick between RuboCop and StandardRB depending on the project. It didn't
quite work the way I expected and more tinkering is needed. I learned a bunch
about how [ale][] works with linters so that's good.

## Highlights

* worked 41:00, no PTO
* published [an episode of Artsy Engineering Radio][aer]

## Next Week

Yesterday I made a list of all the personal project things I have in progress
and it was a lot! This next week I'd like to focus on finishing up a draft blog
post for my [lab notebook][lab_notebook] and some vim integration I was hoping
for. It would be nice to be able to create a new note without leaving vim!
