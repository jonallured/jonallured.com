This week was graduation time at Jack's Karate studio and he did great! He
didn't get the next belt but that's ok. They earn points for doing chores at
home and then can get recognized for that in addition to the actual moves
they're working on. He had been doing a good job with this and ended up placing
third in terms of these points. That got him an award plus a medal and he was
super proud. I'm not tearing up, you are!

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, 0:30 PTO
* published [Bare Boatin' (with Brian Dunn)][pt] for Pudding Time
* published [My Lab Notebook][post-52] on here

## Next Week

Now that I've shipped a post about my [lab notebook][] project I want to get back to
a couple things I've been wanting to add, namely tags. Middleman supports this
but I've not really tinkered with it before. I think this will be a nice way to
find related notes.

Then after that I wanna setup something so that I can easily search through the
notes. This is a bit tricker because it'll involve some tech - maybe
[Elasticsearch][]? Need to do more pondering/research.

Friday I get my second shot and I'm super excited to be fully vaccinated. I
expect to feel a little sick from it based on what people have said and that the
first one knocked me back a bit.
