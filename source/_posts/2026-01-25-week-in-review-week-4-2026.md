title: "Week in Review: Week 4, 2026"
---

This was a weird week on many levels. Monday was a holiday but then people were
talking about a general strike for Friday. No work, no school, no shopping. I
wasn't sure what I would do but then at the same time an insane cold front came
through. The high for Friday was predicted to be -10 F which was enough for
schools to close.

Since Jess and Jack were going to be home and the strike was on I decided to
observe it as well. We basically camped out at home and rested up trying to stay
warm. We watched some coverage of the strike and talked to Jack about why we
were striking and what it meant. We talked about being proud of how the people
of our state were responding to the situation. He's 10 so we did our best.

Then the very next day ICE agents murdered another Minnesota man. Crushed,
pissed, scared, powerless. Lots of feelings. What do I tell my son now?

## Highlights

* worked 24:00, 16:00 PTO
* created [10 Pull Requests][gh-activity]

Most of my time was spent exploring how I will automate the task of announcing
on social media when I pushing a blog post. I have mostly got this working
locally for Bluesky but nothing I'm ready to actually ship just yet. And I want
to get into Mastodon's API too so I can get that automated too.

## Some Best Things

I'm trying out a new section - let me know what you think. The idea is to just
share some of the best things from the week. Here goes.

Some fun new music came out this week. My new favorite band The Barbarians of
California released [Bomb To A Knife Fight][bomb]. In Apple Music it is on a
"single" with a couple other songs that I also really like. A couple days later
Pelican released an EP called [Ascending][]. They are an instrumental metal band
but they did a track with [Geoff Rickly][rickly] which is kinda rad.

I was listening to [episode 199][wio-199] of Working it Out and the guest was
Jordan Jensen. They talked about her new special and that reminded me that I had
noticed it but not watched it yet. She was so funny and cool on the podcast
episode that I paused it and then later that night I watched [Take Me With
You][take-me] and it was also very funny and cool.

A bunch of us went to the Timberwolves game on Thursday and they were playing
the Bulls. I grew up loving the Bulls and so it was really rewarding to watch
them actually pull off an upset and win! This win got them to .500 which...is
better than nothing.

## Next Week

We have a friend in town so I'm excited to see him for a dinner date. There are
also a few other family things including a band concert so you know just a
wholesome Midwestern week coming up. Other than that I can't think of anything
really going on in my area - you?
