This week was very cold and Jack only had two days of school. The [new Mario
game][mario] came out and that's been fun.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00 even, 0:00 PTO taken
* published Pudding Time 14 - [Cow Farts][cow-farts]
* 14 GitHub issues and PRs created
* a new engineer started on my team and it's been so fun

## Next Week

Looks like we'll be warming up a bit here in Minnesota so that's nice. Monday is
Presidents Day and the three of us all have off so the plan is to play the new
Mario game all day. Oscar goes to the vet this week and we have family retro on
Friday.

At work it's the second week of the sprint so that means
retro/grooming/planning. I have a couple interviews setup and my calendar is
full of meetings on Tuesday so protecting time will be important as usual!
