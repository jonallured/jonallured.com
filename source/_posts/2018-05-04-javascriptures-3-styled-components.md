The third in our JavaScriptures series on the Artsy [omakase][omakase]. This
workshop is a deep dive into [Styled Components][sc], where we take our React
app from the first workshop and convert it to use Styled Components. We have
Roop and Jon Allured covering all the details in [the video][video] and
[slides][].
