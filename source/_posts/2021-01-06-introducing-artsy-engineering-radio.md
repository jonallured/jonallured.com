*Note: crossposted from [Artsy's Blog][artsy-link] for posterity.*

Available now on [Apple Podcasts][apple-podcasts], [Spotify][spotify], and
coming soon elsewhere, is Artsy Engineering Radio!

Solving problems in the world of software engineering can mean a lot of
different things, and this podcast will explore what that looks like at Artsy.
If you've followed our blog, you can expect a podcast that sounds like it.
There are a ton of amazing engineers here at Artsy and we're excited for you to
hear their voices and stories. Our hope is that this podcast will make it easy
for more engineers at Artsy to contribute to the public persona of Artsy
Engineering.

We'll release new episodes every other week. Our target episode length is 30
minutes. Some episodes will be technical and others less so. Because [we work in
the open][open] it's easy for us to talk about our work in public.

This isn't the first attempt at an Artsy engineering podcast! Our engineering
team has attempted multiple times to start one. When [Jon][jon] went to create
new Slack and Notion hubs, he found that both already existed. The [PR for the
podcast RSS feed][feed-pr] was opened in July, 2017!

We're beating the fizzle this time, though. We've got momentum and enthusiasm on
our side — several episodes are already published and we've got more lined up.
Instead of tinkering with tooling we're focusing on making episodes, even if
they aren't perfect. Like the software we build, the podcast will get better
over time as we iterate.

What do we have so far? In [episode 0][episode-0], [Jon][jon], [Matt][matt], and
[Steve][steve] introduced the podcast and talked about what you can expect from
future episodes. [Episode 1][episode-1] features a conversation with [Ash][ash]
about facilitating meaningful and inclusive team meetings, and how meetings are
part of building teams, trust, and systems. [Episode 2][episode-2] is a
conversation between [Steve][steve] and [Ash][ash] about how Artsy hires
engineers.

Find the first few episodes right now in your podcast player. Watch for future
episodes in your feed and we'll announce them [on Twitter][twitter] when they're
released.
