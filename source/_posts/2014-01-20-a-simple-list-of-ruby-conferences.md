title: "A Simple List of Ruby Conferences"

*Note: crossposted from [Hashrocket's Blog][hashrocket-link] for posterity.*

I looked for a simple list of upcoming Ruby conferences and didn't find what I
was looking for, so I made one.

[Ruby Conferences][site] is a simple list of Ruby-specific events. You'll find
event dates, location, CFP and registration information. With a kickass design
by fellow Rocketeer Cameron Daigle, this project started as just a list, but
ended up with news published to a [Twitter account][twitter] and a [news
feed][feed].

To come up with the initial list of events and their details, I did a bunch of
Google searching and Twitter stalking. I used [Middleman][] to create the site
and have [a GitHub repo][repo] that I hope people might contribute to with
updates and event information.

So, this is part scratching my own itch and part experiment in collaborative
publishing, mixed with a (hopefully) useful service for the Ruby community. I'd
love any feedback on the site you might have - feel free to email me at
[rubyconfs@gmail.com][email], hit me up at [@rubyconferences][twitter] or open
an [issue on the repo][repo].
