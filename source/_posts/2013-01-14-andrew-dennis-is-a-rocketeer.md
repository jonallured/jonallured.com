Yesterday Andrew Dennis joined Hashrocket and we couldn't be happier to have him
aboard.

Last year he was among the first graduates of DevBootcamp and then went on to
join Groupon as an apprentice. He joins us in Chicago and in addition to
bringing some sweet, sweet technical skills, he's officially the 5th funniest
person in the office. He loves Ruby and sleeves of Oreos. On his todo list -
Obj-C, Cocoa, and Rubymotion.

You can find him on Twitter as [@alzonedout][twitter] or GitHub as
[@adennis4][gh] or in Darth Vader's bathroom.
