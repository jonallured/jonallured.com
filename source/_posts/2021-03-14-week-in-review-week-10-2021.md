This week I was inspired to return to a something that I had sorta forgotten
about: a note taking project called [lab_notebook][ln]. I'm started over with a
slightly different take and it's not done yet but feels promising. More on this
soon I think!


## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [Messy Basement][pt] for Pudding Time
* published [Scaling Your Impact pt 2, this time with Orta][aer] for Artsy Engineering Radio

## Next Week

Jack has Wednesday off school and then next week is his spring break so this
week I'll be working on staying focused at work and setting things up for others
to work. We're taking a long weekend to visit some family in IL.
