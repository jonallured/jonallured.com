Well I was able to find the time to migrate only one of my static sites, but
better than zero!

## Highlights

* worked 32:00, 8:00 PTO
* migrated [fortyeven.com](https://www.fortyeven.com) over to GitHub Actions
  with [verynicecode/forty-site#28][pull-28]

## Next Week

This next week is a short week at work because they're giving us Friday off. I'm
not sure what I'm going to do with the day but I'm really looking forward to it!
