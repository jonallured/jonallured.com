This week I spent more time on the topic of Apache access log data. I have a
machine with Digital Ocean that serves my static websites and I wrote up my
configuration (see below) so I can reproduce it in the future. This config has
been dutifully sending data from this machine to a bucket on S3 for years.

After capturing my config I next turned my attention to looking at the data. I
didn't quite land a post on this exploration just because there's a lot to
unpack but it's coming along nicely.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [Capturing and Storing Apache Access Log Data][post-69] on here

## Next Week

I expect that I'll wrap up the data exploration and post about that. Ultimately
what I'm driving towards is some sort of analytics report that shows me page
views for blog posts. My guess is that once I'm through looking at the data then
that page will be easy to build.
