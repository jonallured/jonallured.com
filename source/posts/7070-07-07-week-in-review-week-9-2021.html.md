---

I didn't get as much done this week outside of work but that's ok, some weeks
are like that. Jess got her second shot on Friday and has felt shitty. This is
her birthday weekend so this sucks even more. Hopefully tomorrow she's back on
track.

## Highlights

* worked 40:15, no PTO
* published a blog post called [Save Nice Feedback You Receive][post-47]
* shipped [a script][pull-77] to template these Week in Review posts

## Next Week

We're starting Sprint 5, 2021 at work next week which seems wild to me. Didn't
we just start this year? It'll be the last sprint before I take some time off
and I'm super ready for it. We're going to visit family in IL. Just a long
weekend since Jack will be off school for spring break.
