title: "Week in Review: Week 12, 2021"
---

Well I missed posting one of these last week but that was because I was out of
town visiting some family. It was so nice and I had no idea how much I needed to
get out of my house, haha. This week was odd too because Artsy decided to shut
down on Friday and give us all a recharge day. Between my trip and that I only
had a two-day work week. ðŸ˜Ž

I used some of that recharge day to make more progress on my lab notebook
project so that's almost ready to talk more about on here. Anyway, here's a WIP
screenshot:

## Highlights

* worked 40:30, 24:00 PTO
* published [Jon's Habits][aer] for Artsy Engineering Radio

## Next Week

I'll be working to catch up from the short week and then also I'm now eligible
for a vaccine so I'm hoping to get that scheduled if I can. I've got some blog
post ideas so it would be great to make some progress on those too.
