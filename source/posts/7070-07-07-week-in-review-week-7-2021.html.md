Monday was a holiday so the week flew by. We talked with a contractor friend of
ours about finishing the basement and came to the conclusion that we can't
afford it. The vet found that Oscar has Lyme disease so we've started some meds
for that but he seems totally fine and normal.

## Next Week

Nothing too unusual about the week so that's nice. It looks like the sub-zero
weather has passed so I'm looking forward to that.
