---

It was a pretty calm week and much warmer outside. The piano tuner came and told
us the house was very dry - turns out we hadn't setup our furnace's humidifier!
I've made a couple recurring reminders in [Todoist][] so that I turn it off each
summer and then get nudged to turn it back on again each winter.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, no PTO
* published [a Pudding Time episode][pt] with my pal [Steve Hicks][hicks]
* published [Generating Social Share Images With Ruby][post-45]
* published [Building Forty In The Open][forty-post] on the Forty blog
* shipped [a Podcasts page][podcasts] to list what I listen to

## Next Week

Tomorrow is March 1st and at work that means we'll start working with a new
marketing tech vendor called [Braze][]. I'm pretty sure I'll spend a lot of time
in the next few weeks learning about how we can integrate their services and it
should be pretty fun!

Next weekend is Jess' birthday so we'll be celebrating as best we can in this
Covid world we find ourselves in.
