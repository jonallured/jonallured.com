title: Edit Files in TextMate From a Remote Server
---

TextMate 2 now includes a [Ruby script][rmate] that will allow one to edit files
on a remote box locally in TextMate. The script needs to be installed on that
server and then you need to do some configuration locally. I don't know, seems
like a lot of bullshit to go through.
