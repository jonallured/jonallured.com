I got my second shot and it really kicked my ass so I didn't get to writing one
of these last weekend. Some of these highlights would have been covered in that
post so I wanted to capture them.

## Highlights

* worked 40:00, 8:00 PTO
* published [Both And][pt-20] for Pudding Time
* published [Distress Signals][pt-21] for Pudding Time
* published [Request for Comment #2][aer-14] for Artsy Engineering Radio
* published [Deploying Static Sites via CircleCI][post-55] on here

## Next Week

I've been tinkering with my DigitalOcean servers, working on updating my guide
for setting up a webserver there. I haven't really touched those servers in a
while so it's been fun to revisit this topic and learn about things I can do to
improve my setup. Hoping to wrap this work up this week and write about it!
