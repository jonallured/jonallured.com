title: Generating Social Share Images With Ruby
---

Inspired by my pal [Steve][hicks-twitter] and his post about [Generating Social
Sharing Images In Eleventy][hicks-post], I decided to work on generating social
share images for my blog. I spent a lot of time on this, probably a lot more
than I should have!

## The Results

I think they turned out pretty great:

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <a href="https://www.jonallured.com/images/post-42/social-share.png">
    <img alt="Social Share Image for Post 42: Start and Stop Your Work Day With a List." src="https://www.jonallured.com/images/post-42/social-share.png" width="512" height="256" />
  </a>
  <p><em>click for bigger</em></p>
</div>

I've got the title of the post laid out nice and big in the center of the top
part and then I added some meta info and a headshot plus my name.

## The Rake Tasks

There are [two rake tasks][rake-tasks] that I use to produce these images - one
takes a path and produces the image for that particular post and the other
produces images for all posts found in the `/source/posts` folder.

I used the `all_social_images` task to backfill the images for all my existing
posts and going forward I can use the `social_image` task for new ones.

## The Ruby Classes

There are two Ruby classes that collaborate to make a social share image:

* [`PostParser`][pp] - given a path, produce an options hash
* [`SocialImage`][si] - given an options hash, use [rmagick][] to write out a PNG

This contract between two classes is great because it allowed me to separate the
activities of parsing and dealing with data from the procedural code around
drawing. I used this seam to get tests around the parsing which was so helpful
as I bumped up against edge cases.

## Parsing a Post into Options

My drawing code wants options that look like this:

```
{
  output_path: "source/images/post-42/social-share.png",
  published_at: Date.parse("2021-02-01"),
  reading_time: 5,
  shrt_url: "jon.zone/post-42",
  title_parts: ["Start and Stop Your Work", "Day With a List"],
  word_count: 740
}
```

The parsing code is responsible for producing this hash which was mostly easy
except for dealing with the title. In fact, I extracted a class called
[`TitleParser`][tp] specifically for parsing post titles!

## The Initial Naive Approach

I was surprised to discover that the hardest part of this project was figuring
out how to wrap the blog post titles. My design supported either a one or two
line title and I assumed rmagick would have some trick where I could send it
some text and the number of lines allowed and it would figuring things out -
nope!

My first approach was naive but actually got me pretty far: split the title
string on space and divide the array into two equal parts.  Turns out
`ActiveSupport` has a nice method for this called [`in_groups`][ig]:

```
> title = 'Playing Around With Content Editable in Rails'
> title_words = title.split
> grouped_words = title_words.in_groups(2, false)
# =>
  [
    ['Playing', 'Around', 'With', 'Content'],
    ['Editable', 'in', 'Rails']
  ]
)
> title_parts = grouped_words.map { |group| group.join(' ') }
# =>
  [
    'Playing Around With Content',
    'Editable in Rails'
  ]
)
```

Take a title with 7 words, split it by space and then ask for two groups with no
filler. Join those nested groups and return our two title parts. We get a pretty
good balance here and this looked good when the PNG was ultimately produced for
[this particular blog post][playing].

## The Workflow

Some titles are short and fit on one line, others are very long and need to have
`...` added at the end. Then there are the multitude in between. In order to
make progress and not get stuck on perfecting my algorithm for this
wrapping/snipping code I ended up with a workflow like this:

* run `rake all_social_images` to use my current algorithm on all posts
* open each image in Preview.app and decide if the title looked good enough
* commit the ones that I liked
* pick one of the ugly ones and write a failing test
* improve title parsing algorithm
* repeat

This process helped me discover the titles that were easy and get those
committed and shipped. The problematic ones I could come back to and write a
test case to specify how I wanted the title to be parsed. That set me up to turn
back to the implementation code and adjust things to make the tests pass. TDD
for the win!

## Testing Title Parsing

The `TitleParser` class takes a title and then returns an array of parts.
Writing tests for this ended up being pretty nice:

```
# spec/lib/title_parser_spec.rb

RSpec.describe TitleParser do
  describe 'with a short title' do
    it 'returns one title part' do
      title = 'Dealing With Rotten Links'
      parts = TitleParser.parse(title)
      expect(parts).to eq(
        [
          'Dealing With Rotten Links'
        ]
      )
    end
  end

  # and more...
end
```

I could find an ugly image, copy the title into a new test and then tinker until
I got it working the way I wanted. Then since the ones I liked were already
checked in, I could ensure my new algorithm didn't screw anything up.

## Open Graph Meta Tags

The next step was to add meta tags for these social share images. Turns out
there is an open source protocol for this called [The Open Graph protocol][ogp].
These tags are added to the `head` of your html document and allow a site like
Twitter to detect them and properly present my content. I ended up discovering
[Unfurler][] as a way to troubleshoot things because I couldn't quite get it to
work the way I expected at first but here's an example of how it looks:

```
<meta name='twitter:card' content='summary_large_image'>
<meta property='og:description' content='I&#39;ve developed a habit that&#39;s at the heart of my personal operating system: I start and stop my work day with a list. Let&#39;s talk about what this means and how it&#39;s improved my work life.  What Does This Even Mean?  It means that when I sit down at...'>
<meta property='og:image' content='https://www.jonallured.com/images/post-42/social-share.png'>
<meta property='og:title' content='Start and Stop Your Work Day With a List'>
<meta property='og:url' content='/posts/2021/02/01/start-and-stop-your-work-day-with-a-list.html'>
```

## Unfurled on Twitter

And here's how it looks on Twitter in all it's unfurled glory:

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <a href="images/post-45/unfurled.png">
    <img alt="Unfurled social share image as seen on Twitter." src="images/post-45/unfurled.png" width="500" />
  </a>
  <p><em>click for bigger</em></p>
</div>

## Forty's Blog Got Them Too

I also did this for the [Forty blog][forty-blog]:

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <a href="images/post-45/forty-unfurled.png">
    <img alt="Unfurled Forty social share image as seen on Twitter." src="images/post-45/forty-unfurled.png" width="500" />
  </a>
  <p><em>click for bigger</em></p>
</div>
