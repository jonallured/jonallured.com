			<p>The project was to take an existing program hobbled together and do it right with Rails. For payment we used PayPal and to serve the video we used Brightcove, so integrating with these services was required. Two apps were developed - one as the actual platform for the training to take place and another just for dealing with the PayPal notifications.</p>

		<h2>Compare And Sync Tool</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>In order to stop printing physical media kits, we decided to digitize the content and this tool kept the live website in sync with a local version for when a salesrep might not have internet access. Using a Ruby script and cron to update a shared Dropbox folder, all reps were kept in sync with any changes Marketing would make to the content of the site. So, its essentially a brochure-type website being scanned for updates and then when detected these updates make their way via Dropbox to a local copy of the site that can be run without internet access.</p>

		<h2>Magazine Subscription Forms</h2>

		<div class="details">
			<p><em>launched:</em> December 2010<br />
				<em>average signups per day:</em> 79 (as of 7/13)<br />
				<em>tech:</em> Sinatra, Nokogiri, Savon, Amazon S3, jQuery, Validate (jQuery Plugin)<br />

			<p>These forms take magazine subscription orders and using a SOAP-based API provided by Allured's Fulfillment house, are inserted directly into the subscription file. One main goal of writing this app was to make Circulation as independent as possible, free to make copy changes and make different offers at different price points.</p>
			<p>Also notable this project has a staging environment as detailed on the Heroku Developer Site.</p>

		<div class="description">
			<p>Designed to accept file uploads from our advertisers, the main purpose of this app was to get away from having advertisers use our FTP site. We wanted something more friendly, especially for hesitant web users, which most advertisers are. As usually happens with internal tools like this, it never gets any love, thus its still on a very old version of Rails.</p>
