				<strong>launched:</strong> March 2011<br />
				<strong>registered users:</strong> 169 (as of 7/7/11)<br />
				<strong>tech:</strong> Rails 3.0.x, delayed_job, Devise, Prawn, jQuery<br />
				<strong>host:</strong> Heroku (bamboo-mri-1.9.2)<br />
				<strong>client:</strong> Allured Business Media</p>

		<div class="description">
			<p>This project involved re-creating an existing training program that Allured had acquired in Rails. The previous program was running off of a WordPress install that had been customized to support a simple authentication system.</p>
			<p>The goal was to convert existing users and provide a new system to deal with taking Quizzes for each Lesson. Brightcove was used to deliver the video and thus integrating their service into the app was required.</p>
