title: Playing Around with Content Editable in Rails

I recently tried working with the `contenteditable` attribute on an internal project at [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com) with my pair [Dave Lyon](http://twitter.com/daveisonthego) and wanted to share what I thought about the experience. Our use case was simple:

> In order to remember things about a Project  
> As a Project Manager on the list of Projects page  
> I want to make or edit a Note

Said another way, we've got a Project list page, each Project can have a Note and we want to be able to create a Note for a given project or edit an existing Note. For such a case you might make a bunch of `<textarea>` tags and then wrap them in forms or maybe bind to `blur` and either create or update a Note all AJAXey.

But this was an internal project and we wanted to try something different. We went through a couple different ideas, starting with something like this:

	<p contenteditable="true" class="note">Note content here!</p>

We created an event handler to fire on `blur` and sent the content of the `<p>` tag to the server. But it wasn't long before we hit enter while editing that `<p>` tag and found that new `<div>` tags were being created. That didn't work like we wanted, so then we wrapped the `<p>` with a `<section>`, like so:
	
	<section contenteditable="true" class="note">
	  <p>Note content here!</p>
	</section>

This way when you hit enter and create more `<p>` tags, they'd be contained inside the parent and we could send the content of `<section>` to the server. That was closer, but didn't feel quite right. Next we had the idea to just use a `<ul>`, like this:
	
	<ul contenteditable="true" class="note">
	  <li>Note content here!</li>
	</ul>

We liked this because then we'd just store the `<li>` tags in the database and it was nice and clean. I threw together a little [demo page](http://files.jonallured.com/content-editable/demo.html) you can use to play around with our different approaches.

My take away here is that `contenteditable` is really only suitable for cases where you actually want HTML nodes to be created. Its perfect for something like a WYSIWYG editor or the [Mercury Editor](http://railscasts.com/episodes/296-mercury-editor), things that aim to allow editing of a page right in the page. But for something like what we were doing, I think it was overkill.

Also, I'm not completely comfortable with its cross-browser support. I don't have access to IE anymore, but I was able to experiment with Chrome, Safari and FireFox. From what I could tell the two WebKit browsers were fairly consistent in how they implemented the details of this attribute, but FireFox does some different things. For instance, `<br>` tags seem to be added at the end of everything.

Still, `contenteditable` is a cool attribute and I was glad to learn a little more about it. Give [that demo](http://files.jonallured.com/content-editable/demo.html) a whirl and consider it the next time you need something like this.
