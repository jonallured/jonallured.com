title: Pair With Me on Anything!

Last week I saw [Avdi Grimm](http://devblog.avdi.org/) give an excellent talk
at [Ancient City Ruby](http://ancientcityruby.com/). He talked about his
experience being a remote pairing consultant and what it was like to pair with
lots of people. He reflected on the benefits of working like this and the
perspective its given him.

Near the end of the talk he challenged the audience to pair both more often and
also more widely. He asked whether people would be willing to pair with a
stranger and a majority of the hands in the room went up.

[A website](http://www.pairprogramwith.me/) has been setup to help facilitate
this project and he mentioned some Twitter hashtags to help connect people. It
was a great talk and I was inspired to set aside some time to do more remote
pairing.

I've added [a page](http://jonallured.com/pair/) to this site where you can
send me a note to find a time to remote pair. I'm also going to find people
that I'd like to pair with and ask them if they've got time.

So, if you have something you'd like to pair on, please use [that
form](http://jonallured.com/pair/) or [hit me up on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/jonallured) and let's figure out a time to work
together!
