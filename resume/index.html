	<h1>Resum&eacute;</h1>
	<h2 id="objectiveHeading">Professional Objective</h2>
	<p>I'm looking to make a career change. I want out of the Publishing industry and into a software development company, specifically one that specializes in web applications and cares about design.</p>
	<p>I love building websites and I want to work with clients that have great application ideas, but need help making them happen.</p>
	<h2>Development Skills</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Project planning, including creating user types, card sorting, and producing an Information Architecture all before any code is written</li>
		<li>Project management, especially coordinating the design, programming and content</li>
		<li>Semantic HTML, Javascript (jQuery too) and enough CSS to make it look good in Webkit and Gecko</li>
		<li>Ruby and the Rails framework (Sinatra too); experience with Rails 3.0.x on Ruby 1.9.2</li>
		<li>Git and GitHub, also worked with SVN</li>
		<li>Familiar with common Ruby Gems like Devise, Prawn, delayed_job and aws-s3</li>
		<li>Good with Mac OS X and the Bash shell; TextMate is my editor of choice</li>
		<li>Deploying and scaling on Heroku using various add-ons</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Attitudes about Development</h2>
	<p>I believe what makes someone really good at designing and developing software is having <strong>empathy</strong> for users. You have to care about what its like to be a hesitant web user and take their needs seriously. This is the attitude I bring to my work and its what I'm most proud of.</p>
	<p>Bringing <strong>clarity</strong> to projects is as much about what you leave out as what you include. Sure, its about great copy and usable interfaces, but its also about <strong>saying no</strong>. I care about keeping the things I work on <strong>focused</strong> on what's really important.</p>
	<p>Being a part of the technology industry means being open to constantly <strong>learning</strong> new things. Success means more than that though&mdash;you need to be internally motivated to do this. You have to <em>want</em> to learn, to see it as your responsibility to teach yourself things. That's how I learned Rails and its what I love about working in this field.</p>
