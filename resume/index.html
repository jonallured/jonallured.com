  <h1>Resum&eacute;</h1>
  <h2 id="objectiveHeading">Professional Objective</h2>
  <p>I want to work for a software development company; specifically one that specializes in web applications and cares about design. I love building websites and I want to work with clients that have great application ideas, but need help making them happen.</p>
  <h2>Development Skills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Project planning, including creating user types, card sorting, and producing an Information Architecture</li>
    <li>Agile practices including daily standups, story writing and iteration planning meetings</li>
    <li>Project management, especially coordinating the design, programming and content</li>
    <li>Semantic HTML, Javascript (jQuery too) and enough CSS to make it look good in Webkit</li>
    <li>Ruby and the Rails framework (Sinatra too); experience with Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.0.x</li>
    <li>Git and GitHub, also worked with SVN</li>
    <li>Familiar with common Ruby Gems like Devise, Prawn, delayed_job and aws-s3</li>
    <li>Unit tests with Rspec and Integration testing with Cucumber</li>
    <li>Comfortable with pair programming</li>
    <li>Good with OS X and the Bash shell</li>
    <li>Deploying and scaling on Heroku; installation of common Heroku Add-ons</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Attitudes about Development</h2>
  <p>I think the thing that makes me really good at developing software is the high value I place on having <strong>empathy</strong> for users. You need to be able to look at what you're working on from their perspective and take their needs seriously.</p>
  <p>Bringing <strong>clarity</strong> to projects is as much about what you leave out as what you include. Sure, it's about great copy and usable interfaces, but it's also about <strong>saying no</strong>. I care about keeping the things I work on <strong>focused</strong> on what's really important.</p>
  <p>Being a part of the technology industry means being open to constantly <strong>learning</strong> new things. You have to <em>want</em> to learn and understand that it is your responsibility to teach yourself new things. That's how I learned Rails and it's what I love about working in this field.</p>
